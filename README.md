# Hotel Revenue Data Analysis
The hotel business is a dynamic one that relies heavily on a number of factors, such as marketing strategies, efficient management, and customer satisfaction. One of the most important metrics in this sector is revenue, which includes income generated via its various operations and services, including room rentals, food and beverage sales, event and conference bookings, and other auxiliary services.
